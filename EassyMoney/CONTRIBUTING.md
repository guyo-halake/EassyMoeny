# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to help — we keep things friendly and practical.

How to get started
1. Fork the repo and open a branch named `feat/short-description` or `fix/short-description`.
2. Follow the commit style below and make a small, testable change.
3. Open a Pull Request with a clear description (see PR template).

Commit convention
- Use Conventional Commits style. Examples:
  - `feat(payments): add confirmation message`
  - `fix(ui): improve phone input validation`

Pull requests
- Write a short summary and a "Why this matters" blurb to explain the user impact.
- Link any related issues and add screenshots or recordings for UI changes.

Testing & local setup
- Run `npm install` then `npm run start` and verify the relevant screen/workflow.

First PR checklist
- [ ] Branch follows naming convention
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and follow Conventional Commits
- [ ] PR description includes a short "Why this matters" section
- [ ] Changes are limited and easy to review
