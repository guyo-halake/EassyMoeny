# Design system notes

This is a lightweight guide for colors, spacing, and accessibility.

Tokens
- Colors: use `src/theme/colors.js` (or `app/theme`) for primary, accent, text, and background colors.
- Spacing: stick to the spacing scale in `src/theme/spacing`.

Accessibility
- Ensure contrast >= 4.5:1 for body text.
- Provide meaningful labels on inputs and buttons.

Design approach
- Keep interfaces calm and conversational. Use clear labels, small tips under inputs, and friendly confirmation language.
