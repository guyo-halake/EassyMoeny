# Components Library (human notes)

This document describes shared components and how to use them in a friendly way.

- `GlassmorphicView` (shared): A lightweight card that gives a soft translucent background. Use for summaries and transaction cards to keep the UI gentle and readable.
- `StyledText` / Themed text: Use these for consistent typography and color across screens.


Where to find
- `src/components/shared/` and `components/` folders.
