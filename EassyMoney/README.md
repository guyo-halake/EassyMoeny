# EassyMoney (LooPay)

Welcome — this is a human-first mobile app prototype for sending money quickly and kindly.

What this repo contains
- A lightweight Expo React Native app with screens, shared components, and a small theme.
- Friendly copy and dev docs to help new contributors get started.

Quick start (local)
1. Install dependencies:
```powershell
cd EassyMoney
npm install
```
2. Start the Expo dev server:
```powershell
npm run start
```
3. Open the app in the Expo Go app or a simulator.

What we care about (human-first goals)
- Empathetic microcopy and clear UX flows for onboarding, errors, and confirmations.
- Small design system and accessibility basics.
- Friendly contributor experience: clear docs, templates, and checklists.

Where to look first
- `app/` and `src/` — app entry, screens, and components.
- `docs/` — design tokens, component library notes, checklists.
- `.github/` — issue and PR templates, and CI workflow.

If you'd like help picking a task, open an issue titled "Good first change" and we can pair on wording, styles, or accessibility.

Thanks for contributing — let's build something people enjoy using.
